    Answer one word (yes/no/unsure) using these rules:
    - Bill id massively increases confidence if present (H or S + number, with/without dot/space)
    - Wrong bill id is a strong negative indicator
    - summary → must have:
        • "Summary" near it (case insensitive), OR
        • a malegislature.gov link whose filename/title has bill id + "Summary", OR
        • policy/topic-style prose (not navigation, login, or site boilerplate).
    - vote record → look for ("vote"|"yea"|"nay"|"favorable"|"recommendation"|"committee")
    - Ignore boilerplate.
    Output exactly: yes|no|unsure.
